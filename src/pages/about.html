			<h2>How come I make this site?</h2>
			<p>
				So I saw
				<a href="https://voidreality.neocities.org" target="_blank"
					>this neocities site</a
				>, and I thought it was pretty creative (though made me feel uneasy).
				Then I look it up more of neocities sites like
				<a href="https://cinni.net" target="_blank">cinni's</a>,
				<a href="https://lostlove.neocities.org" target="_blank">lunospace</a>,
				and more I didn't mention. They all have their own personality. But the
				common thing of them is that they are written with good ol' regular
				<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
				<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript.
			</p>
			<p>
				So I
				decided to hop in because I feel like I just want to go back a bit :&rpar;.
			</p>
			<p>
				The design came straight into my mind when I was in the lecture. I want my website to be a place where I would come and chill: listening to lo-fi music, while playing some simple games in my website themed with a night city. So there goes my design.

					? " (it's my birthday!)"
					: "";
			document.getElementById("age").innerText =
				new Date(dmy - birthday).getFullYear() - 1970 + itsMyBirthday;
